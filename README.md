# PopDouble
Small Jupyter Notebook for finding population doublings for the Telomere project. 

## Settings
To get results you will need to adjust initial and final population densities:
- set `initial_population` to the cell count on the beginning of your experiment used as inoculum.
- set `final_population_ml` to the /ml cell count at the time you want to measure population doublings.
- set `final_culture_volume` to the volume of your final culture.
